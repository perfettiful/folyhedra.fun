              Polaris has been humanity's guiding star for thousands of years. 
              Located almost exactly at the North Celestial Pole, it appears stationary 
              while all other stars rotate around it.

            <p>
              Just as Polaris is the fixed point around which the heavens turn, 
              the tetrahedron is a fundamental shape in geometry - the simplest 
              3D polyhedron, with perfect symmetry and minimal complexity.

              This explorer examines all possible ways to connect the vertices of a 
              tetrahedron with edges, creating incomplete tetrahedral structures. 
              Each represents a different subgraph of the complete tetrahedral graph K‚ÇÑ.
